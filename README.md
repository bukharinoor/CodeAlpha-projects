# CodeAlpha-projects
Predicts Titanic survival using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, based on features like age, gender, and passenger class. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.
# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Data Science Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes the **Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques. We explore how different factors (such as age, gender, and class) influenced survival chances.

## 🔍 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key patterns and relationships in the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Applying ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It contains details about passengers, including their survival status.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
